## Course Description

This course examines policy implementation as a political process shaped by power, institutions, organized interests, and social groups. It explores how states build capacity and deliver policies, how bureaucracies perform, how citizens experience government, and how those experiences feed back into politics and public policy. A central theme is decision-making. We analyze how politicians, bureaucrats, and citizens make *political* choices in light of their institutional environments, objectives, information, incentives, and constraints. Because research on the politics of public policy is interdisciplinary, we read both foundational and cutting-edge work from political science, economics, sociology, public law, and public administration.

The course also intentionally exposes students to diverse cases. It primarily engages American politics and public policy, but also examines European, Latin American, South Asian, and East Asian cases because, as Seymour M. Lipset (1922-2006) [noted](https://www.journalofdemocracy.org/articles/seymour-martin-lipset-1922-2006/), "a person who knows only one country knows no countries." Substantively, we cover multiple policy domains, including safety net programs, criminal justice, housing, and international development, with topics ranging from how state institutions have historically evolved to how to make government use of artificial intelligence more accountable.

The course's readings, in-class activities, and assignments are designed to help students understand that normative, theoretical, empirical, methodological, and practical elements are all essential for producing research, generating evidence, and improving practice in this area.

This course equips students to grasp the political dimensions of policy implementation and to analyze institutional terrain, organizational challenges, key actors, and strategic choices. It also helps students design policy innovations that deliver results, encounter less resistance, and build broader, stronger coalitions.

## Course Expectations

### Attendance

You are expected to attend every class in person. There will be no video recordings.

### Reading

You should complete all assigned readings. These are social science research articles and book chapters, not fiction or poetry, so you do not need to focus on individual words or phrases. Instead, focus on the argument, evidence, structure, and style.

No books need to be purchased. All readings will be available on the course website.

### In-class discussions

When completing the assigned readings, come prepared to discuss the following questions:

1. **Convergence:** What common practical problems, theoretical questions, or methodological approaches do the authors engage with?

2. **Divergence:** Where do their approaches diverge, how do they differ, and why do these differences matter?

3. **Gaps:** What do they miss, how do they miss it, and why does it matter?

4. **Extensions:** How might we apply the insights from these readings to cases or contexts the authors did not address?

This is the basic structure of the class. Each week, I will review the readings and provide a brief lecture. I will occasionally cold call students (email me in advance if you would like to be excused) to check your understanding of the readings.

After the lecture, you will break into small groups of five to six students to discuss the questions above. We will then regroup and share key insights.

On the final class day of each week, I will also preview the readings for the following week.

When assignments are due, I will explain what is expected and how to complete them. After submission, I will provide collective feedback in class on what was done well and what can be improved.

## Course Policies

### Assignments

There are no pop quizzes, midterms, or final exams.

Assignments are designed to help you develop your analytical skills and your ability to diagnose and address the political dimension of real implementation challenges.

#### Statement of individual or group research topic (maximum 5-6 pages)

Identify a real policy implementation problem that involves a political challenge. Begin by defining your policy domain, the specific implementation problem, your client, and your role.

As the policy entrepreneur assigned to this case, analyze why the policy is failing or producing uneven outcomes and develop solutions grounded in political and institutional analysis that you can present to your client.

This is a brief proposal of no more than 5–6 pages. At this stage, the goal is to identify a promising policy implementation problem rather than to fully solve it. You should expect to further develop, narrow, and refine your core question, scope, and analytic focus over the course of the semester as you receive feedback and complete the in-class exercises, culminating in the final research paper.

You may work individually or in a group of three to four students, ideally with overlapping interests and complementary skills.

#### Research paper (only two sections)

You will submit the implementation and political analysis sections separately and receive collective feedback in class. I prefer giving collective feedback at this stage because students often encounter similar challenges, and seeing these patterns together helps everyone learn more effectively.

You will then receive individual feedback from your peers, and finally receive my feedback on the final paper that integrates both sections.

Peer review is part of the assignment for two reasons. First, for innovation, receiving critical feedback is as important as generating creative ideas (see [Jon Bendor's interview](https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/insights/jonathan-bendor-why-criticism-good-innovation)). You want new ideas but also need a way to sort good ones from bad ones. Second, it is often easier to develop your tastes by critiquing someone else's work than your own.

As part of developing these sections, you will complete three in-class exercises. These exercises are not graded and are designed to provide concrete feedback. First, you will deliver a short elevator pitch to clarify your core question, policy domain, and analytic focus. Second, you will participate in a chalkboard exercise that maps the implementation journey, tracing both the citizen experience and the agency perspective. Third, you will complete a second chalkboard exercise that maps the political landscape, including key actors, power relationships, and points of leverage from the standpoint of a policy entrepreneur. These exercises are intended to help you refine your analysis before writing and are directly tied to the sections you submit.

**a. Implementation Problem Section**

- What are the intended policy outcomes?
- What are the actual policy outcomes?
- Remember that to analyze outcomes systematically, you need variation, so include both successful and unsuccessful cases.
- Briefly explain why these uneven outcomes emerge, including political and other explanations. You will expand on the political analysis in the next section.

**b. Political Analysis Section**

**b.1. Describe the political landscape and the status quo.**

- What institutional environment shapes this implementation problem?
- Who are the main actors? What are their tasks, motivations, incentives, and constraints?
- How do these actors interact, collaborate, or conflict with one another?
- For each question above, explain how you know that your description and interpretation are correct and plausible. Provide credible references.

**b.2. Take the perspective of the policy entrepreneur seeking to improve the status quo. You may create an imaginary actor or choose an existing one.**

- What is your political strategy, and what ethical and practical considerations guide it?
- Who are your allies and opponents, and how do you know?
- How can you build, sustain, and expand coalitions, and why do you think those strategies will work?
- For each question above, explain why your argument is valid and support it with evidence. Provide credible references.

#### Peer Review Report

You will know which individual or group's draft you are responsible for by Week 14.

- Be critical but also constructive.
- Suggest theoretical frames they might have missed, given the course readings and beyond.
- Suggest empirical evidence that they could collect and utilize.
- Suggest a normative dimension that they may engage with.
- Suggest a strategic approach they may consider.

#### Response Letter

You should submit your response letter along with your final paper.

- You should respond to all comments.
- If you incorporate the suggestions, briefly explain how you did so.
- If you decided not to incorporate, explain why it's justified.

Additional guidelines for the assignments are detailed [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/121UhG5mLhAawLvmeDhazL0Kf7M9reDu4/view?usp=sharing).

### How Assignment Marks Convert Into Final Grades

All assignments (including drafts, peer review, and the final paper) will be graded using the check system:

- **Check +** (exceeds expectation)
- **Check** (meets expectations; minor issues)
- **Check −** (doesn't meet expectations; major issues)
- **No Credit** (missing, incomplete, factual inaccuracies, or fabricated/misrepresented references)

Each assignment will be evaluated on three dimensions:

1. Strength of argument, logical structure, and engagement with course concepts
2. Use of proper evidence and references
3. Accuracy and completeness

To receive a Check +, your work must:

1. Answer all requested questions clearly and accurately,
2. Show strong understanding of course concepts
3. Include thoughtful criticism, extension, or original insight
4. Demonstrate clear reasoning and well-organized writing
5. Use credible evidence and reference appropriately

To calculate final course grades, each mark will be converted into a numerical score: Check + = 95, Check = 85, Check − = 75, Incomplete / No Credit = 0

These numerical scores will be combined using the assignment weightings listed below.

- Participation in in-class discussions, including attendance --- **10%**
- Statement of individual or group research topic (due Thu, Feb 5) --- **10%**
- Draft implementation problem section (due Thu, Feb 19) --- **10%**
- Draft political analysis section (due Thu, Mar 5) --- **10%**
- Draft paper for peer review (due Thu, Apr 9) --- **20%**
- Peer review of another group or individual's draft (due Thu, Apr 16) --- **10%**
- Final paper, including a response letter to the peer review (due Wed, April 29) --- **40%**

The resulting average will then be translated into a letter grade using the final grading scale:

- **94 and above:** A
- **90 to 93:** A-
- **87 to 89:** B+
- **83 to 86:** B
- **80 to 82:** B-
- **77 to 79:** C+
- **73 to 76:** C
- **70 to 72:** C-
- **67 to 69:** D+
- **60 to 67:** D
- **Below 60:** F

### Missed class and late assignments

**Attendance:** Missing class more than a few times will lower your participation grade.

**Due dates:** Assignments are due at the beginning of class on the assigned day. The final assignment is due by 12:00 PM (ET) on the assigned day.

**Late work policy:**

Late assignments will drop **one step per 24 hours**:

- **Check + → Check**
- **Check → Check−**
- **Check − → 70** (C− equivalent)
- After that: 5 additional points deducted per 24 hours

**Extensions:** If you know you will miss a deadline for a valid reason, contact me beforehand to arrange a new deadline without penalty.

**Illness or university-approved excuses:** No penalty with proper documentation.

**Disabilities:** Please let me know within the first two weeks if you need any accommodations.

**Academic Honesty:** You may study together, but all submitted work must be your own. The Honor Code applies to all assignments, and your name on the work affirms your compliance.

**Responsible AI Use:** If you put your name on an assignment, you are responsible for its accuracy and integrity. You may use generative AI, but you must do so responsibly. For example, if you cite references that do not exist, you will receive a zero on that assignment.

**Caveat:** I treat the syllabus as a roadmap for a joint project. Education is a collective action problem. A roadmap sometimes needs updates because we never have full information at the start of any journey. If I need to make any changes to the syllabus, including due dates, I will announce them as early as possible so students can adjust their schedules.
